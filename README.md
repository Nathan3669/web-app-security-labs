# Web Application Security Labs

This repository contains hands-on examples of common web application security vulnerabilities and their secure implementations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- How web vulnerabilities occur
- Why they are dangerous
- How they can be mitigated using secure coding practices

---

## 🔐 Covered Vulnerabilities
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Each vulnerability includes:
- A vulnerable implementation
- A secure implementation
- A clear explanation of the issue and fix

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand real-world web security flaws
- Apply secure coding techniques
- Develop a security-first mindset when building applications

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These examples are for **educational purposes only**.  
Do not deploy vulnerable code in production environments.
